Mission
To elevate mental health awareness, reduce stigma, and expand culturally responsive support for Latino individuals who have undergone chemotherapy—through bilingual education, peer connection, and trusted community partnerships—so they and their families can heal and thrive.
Vision
A future where Latino cancer survivors and their families have equitable access to trauma‑informed, culturally grounded mental health care; feel seen and supported in their language and culture; and experience resilient, dignified survivorship within strong, connected communities.

Community Outreach
At Humanity Touches, we mobilize the community to provide for unhoused members, support seniors, strengthen food security, provide inclusive teaching for people with disabilities, and offer free pickleball clinics for underserved families—rooted in bilingual, culturally responsive, and trauma‑informed practices. Our outreach complements our core focus on mental health awareness for Latino cancer survivors by meeting families where they are with practical resources, movement, connection, and dignity.
